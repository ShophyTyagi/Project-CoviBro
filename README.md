Long description – 

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may be stressful for people. Fear and anxiety about a new disease and what could happen can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children. Public health actions, such as social distancing, can make people feel isolated and lonely and can increase stress and anxiety. However, these actions are necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Coping with stress in a healthy way will make you, the people you care about, and your community stronger. Project COVIBRO aims towards addressing the most basic concern there is during such times of the pandemic, an overwhelming amount of resources available for someone who just wants to know a gist about it. 
Wouldn't it have been better if there existed a platform that separated the wheat from the chaff and got us information that would help us directly? COVIBRO, our chatbot powered by IBM Watson backed by Watson Discovery Service that’s got a human touch to it does just that, COVIBRO has been designed from scratch to address the concerns of a not so literate but a capable mobile user who can only understand so much. Its primary user would-be citizens who are moderately informed about the condition of the pandemic worldwide, this includes kids and higher age demographics, both of which in today’s generation are very capable of using a website both on a desktop or a mobile. COVIBRO has been submitted in a deployed state, ready to take on queries and answer them and learn about the ones that it does not know about yet. To keep the user experience as simple yet impactful as possible, this project has been deployed onto a WordPress backed selection primarily due to the wide range of add-on plugins. Using the API Integration and the tutorials provided, COVIBRO has been successfully deployed onto the domain (www.dockthis.tech) managed by our team. 
Another important aspect of the chatbot has been the factoring in of those people, who are experiencing loneliness and need someone to talk to about the stress and pandemic situation. COVIBRO, at a starter level, is successful in the figure of speech it uses as well as the Call To Actions directed towards the user so they can be led to more qualified resources. The chatbot provides phone numbers of local health institutions to help people obtain medical help faster. 
With this, our submission to the IBM Call for Code 2020 Hackathon is aimed towards helping those in need but feel the pressure when they reach the steps of a google search bar. We believe COVIBRO has the potential to scale up with more services added to it, namely on-demand psychological counseling support, and a grievance address system that could be routed to the concerned government authorities.
